# Ecomobility
# https://trotinete-de-la-haufe.vercel.app/
### An app that is designed to help people find the best way to get around the city, meaning with electro scooters.
# How it works(For now)
### It is a simple app made in 7 hours using Next.js 14.  It has user autenthification, dynamic rendering and other smart words that I don't know what they mean.
# How the app should have worked:
## Here is a checklist of what I wanted to do:
- [X] Create a simple app that has a login page and a home page
- [X] Create a database that stores the users and their passwords
- [:(] Create a database that stores the scooters and their locations(For now I have a JSON file)
- [X] Create a page that shows the user the scooters that are near him
- [X] Create a page that shows the user the scooters that are near him and are available
- [:(] Create a page that shows the user the scooters that are near him and are available and are charged
- [X] Create a cool welcome message that is dynamically typed and highlighted
- [X] Create a cool login page that has a cool background
- [X] Create a cool home page that has a cool background
- [X] Create a cool profile that welcomes the user and shows his username
- [X] Create a component that will change the availability of the scooter when a user clicks reserve
- [:(] Show and change the battery percentage
- [:(] The users can have a wallet where they can put the money for the rides
- [:(] Tax users for the ride
- [:(] Make different type of users like admin and simple user, so the admin can add or remove the scooters
- [:(] Make a map where the user can see all the scooters and their position alongside with his position

# What can i say
### The first 5 hours I was focused on implementing things like login,profile, cool background and I almost forgot about what i was supposed to do, sorry.
Would be cool if I get an internship, if i get it i would tell you 2 hillarious anecdotes ;)
